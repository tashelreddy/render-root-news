    <p>Artist -Shelene Reddie</p>
  <br>
    <p>The artist, whose identity remains a well-guarded secret, has crafted a world within the confines of this canvasâ€”a world where time stands still,
       and the soul takes flight. The colors used are nothing short of breathtaking. 
       Soft pastels blend seamlessly with deep, velvety hues, creating a harmonious  dance of light and shadow. Each stroke of the brush seems 
      to breathe life into the canvas, as if the artist has harnessed the very essence of existence.

    <h2>Moses was not about that life!</h2>
    
    <p>Moses was up there hiding in them bushes making sure nobody and I mean NOBODY could hurt 
      his brothers.
      Dude was saying stuff like Pharoah's daughter was no longer his mom and he refused to 
      be considered a rich boy architech.
      Homeboy was ready to do away with all a that, he was not here for private education
      while the kingPharoah had his fellow brothers working hard in the sun. 
      He was what we call today a "DEFENDER".

    <p>Cruising and moving and grooving, if you are a travel queen or king then this latest trend might be interesting.
      A new bikini and mens swimwear line is to be launched early October during the October fest in Busan. 
      These are not the regular printed swimwear with anchors on them,
      these are considered to be safe and secure for all customers; not just safe, but also affordable. 
      We look forward to this new line, and we are hoping that they are not like the Kylie swims, 
      because nobody wants their undies falling off in  the water at the beach or pool. <b>-The girl</b>

    <h1>Why Birds Are Hated</h1>
    <h3>The question on  many concerened citizens mind and rooves.</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Most people hating on birds mostly because they are noisy, also people are questioning how it is 
      that they get to go anywhere without people considering it a conceren for their safety.
      The worst part is they get to tresspass and it is OK, but when others do it it is considered "trespassing".
